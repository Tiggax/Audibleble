# audibleble
## a personal audible sync that automaticlly downloads new books and then converts them to MP3 to play. the code used is made possible by:
1. https://github.com/KrumpetPirate/AAXtoMP3
2. https://pypi.org/project/audible/
## Before you start!
1. you need to install the AAYtoMP3 from KrumpetPirate, for it to work!
1. you need to run Create_account.py to create a account file for it to work. (yes, you need a Audible account, with bought books)
1. whenever you want to sync your library you run the RUN.py file (edit it beforehand to change working directoryies, where you want to save stuff, etc.)

you can also add the Run file to background processes, but it will hoq some ram if it finds a file to sync.

# Enjoy!
